    "Q1 What is a RESTful API?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- \n",
    "A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a way for systems to communicate over the web using the HTTP protocol and a set of standard rules or constraints. It allows clients (like browsers or mobile apps) to interact with servers (where data lives) in a simple, stateless, and scalable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts of RESTful APIs:\n",
    "Resources and URIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything is considered a resource (e.g., users, products, orders).\n",
    "\n",
    "Resources are identified by URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), e.g., https://api.example.com/users/123.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP Methods:\n",
    "RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "GET – Retrieve a resource\n",
    "\n",
    "POST – Create a new resource\n",
    "\n",
    "PUT – Update an existing resource (or replace it)\n",
    "\n",
    "PATCH – Partially update a resource\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE – Remove a resource\n",
    "\n",
    "Stateless:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process it. The server doesn’t remember past requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON/XML Responses:\n",
    "\n",
    "Most REST APIs return data in JSON format (JavaScript Object Notation), but sometimes XML is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform Interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "A consistent way of interacting with resources, typically using HTTP verbs and standard response codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose you're working with a RESTful API for a task manager:\n",
    "\n",
    "GET /tasks → Retrieve all tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "GET /tasks/1 → Retrieve task with ID 1\n",
    "\n",
    "POST /tasks → Create a new task\n",
    "\n",
    "PUT /tasks/1 → Update task with ID 1\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE /tasks/1 → Delete task with ID 1\n",

    "Q2 Explain the concept of API specification?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "An API specification is a detailed, formal document that describes how an API works — what it does, how to use it, and what to expect in return. It acts as a contract between the API provider and the API consumer.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "The URLs or routes where the API can be accessed\n",

    "Example: GET /users/{id} or POST /products\n",

    "\n",
    "What kind of operation is supported (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)\n",

    "The structure and data types expected in the request payload (often in JSON or XML)\n",
    "\n",

    "Q3 What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
    "Ans:- \n",
    "Flask is a lightweight web framework written in Python that is widely used for building web applications and APIs. It’s especially popular for creating RESTful APIs due to its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use.\n",
    "Flask is a microframework, meaning it provides the basic tools to get a web app or API running, without enforcing strict project structure or including unnecessary features by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s built on Werkzeug (a WSGI utility library) and Jinja2 (a templating engine), but you don’t need to use the templating part if you're only building APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Flask is Popular for Building APIs\n",
    "1. Simplicity and Minimalism\n",
    "You can build a working API with just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "No boilerplate or configuration overload.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Flexibility\n",
    "Doesn’t force a specific structure or tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easily integrates with databases, authentication systems, and third-party libraries.\n",
    "3. Strong Ecosystem\n",
    "Extensions like Flask-RESTful, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-JWT make it easy to build more complex APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Great for Prototypes and Startups\n",
    "Ideal for quick development and iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to scale up later if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Well-Supported and Documented\n",
    "Large community, lots of tutorials and examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Official documentation is clear and concise.\n"
