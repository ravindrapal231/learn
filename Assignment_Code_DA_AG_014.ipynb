        "**Answer**:-\n",
        "Ensemble Learning in machine learning refers to a technique where multiple models (often called \"learners\" or \"base models\") are combined to solve a particular problem and improve performance compared to any single model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Idea Behind Ensemble Learning:\n",
        "The core idea is that a group of weak learners (models that perform just slightly better than random guessing) can come together to form a strong learner, which results in better accuracy, stability, and generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is based on the principle that diverse opinions (models) can cancel out individual errors, just like a group of people guessing the weight of an object might average to the correct answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why Ensemble Learning Works:\n",
        "It reduces variance (e.g., in decision trees using Bagging)\n",
        "\n",
        "It reduces bias (e.g., in boosting techniques)\n",
        "\n",
        "It improves predictions through model averaging or voting\n",

        "**Common Types of Ensemble Methods**:\n",
        "Method\tDescription\n",
        "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)\tTrains multiple models on different random subsets of data (with replacement). Example: Random Forest.\n",
        "Boosting\tTrains models sequentially, where each new model focuses on the errors of the previous ones. Example: AdaBoost, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting.\n",
        "Stacking\tCombines predictions from several models using another model (meta-learner) to make the final prediction.\n",
        "Voting\tCombines predictions from multiple models using majority vote (classification) or average (regression).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example**:\n",
        "In a credit scoring system:\n",
